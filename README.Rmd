# sbcrs

This package provides tools to simplify the implementation of
    simulation based calibration using rank statistics (Talts, Betancourt, Simpson, Vehtari, and Gelman, [arXiv:1804.06788](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06788)). It implements a very similar validation procedure to that in `rstan::sbc` but using a different workflow. In `rstan::sbc`, the Stan model must be modified by the user to generate rank statistics during sampling. In this package, the Stan model is left unmodified, and the code needed to calculate the rank statistics is written in R. This provides a potentially faster development workflow (Stan recompiles are not needed). It also allows SBC to be used in cases where generating parameters from their prior distributions, or the modeled variable from the likelihood function, would be too complicated if written in Stan.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of sbcrs from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("sbcrs") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jasonmtroos/sbcrs")
```

The package vignettes are a useful starting point:

* `intro-to-sbc` provides an overview to simulation-based calibration, and the features of the SBC package

* `funnel` shows how SBC identified sampling problems in Neal's funnel

* `comparison-to-rstan-sbc` implements the example from `rstan::sbc` using this package, shows the rank statistics are  the same, and provides a basis for understanding the different design philosophies behind the two approaches.
